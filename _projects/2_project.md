# Amoeba Data: Data Science for good

## Introduction
Amoeba Data is a pro bono data science consultancy dedicated to aiding organizations that make a positive impact on the world.

## The Genesis of Amoeba Data
We realized that many projects and companies focused on social good lack the resources for data science work, despite its potential to significantly advance their missions. This realization sparked the creation of Amoeba Data. Understanding that data science services can be expensive and out of reach for such organizations, we committed ourselves to filling this gap. We offer our top-tier data science expertise to non-profits, NGOs, and other socially driven organizations at no cost, believing firmly in the power of data to drive social change.

## Our Mission
Our mission is clear – to leverage data science in solving some of the most pressing economic, healthcare, social, and environmental issues. Whether it’s through predictive analytics, machine learning models, insightful data visualizations, or data science workshops, we are here to make a difference.
