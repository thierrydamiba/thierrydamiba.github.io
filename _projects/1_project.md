# Learning about Large Language Models on Low-Resource Hardware to Deliver Value to Emerging Markets

## Introduction
In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, Large Language Models (LLMs) are leading AI innovation. As a data scientist passionate about technology and societal progress, I am on a journey to understand how LLMs work and gain insight into the impact of LLMs, especially in emerging markets. This journey will be undertaken on modest hardware, reflective of the realities in developing regions.

## Learning LLMs in Four Parts 
Inspired by M Labomme, I have broken my learning into four parts:
1. **LLM Fundamentals**: Acquiring essential knowledge about mathematics, Python, and neural networks, forming the foundation of understanding how LLMs work.
2. **LLM Scientist**: Focuses on building LLMs using cutting-edge techniques, delving into the architecture of LLMs, intricacies of dataset creation, and nuances of model training and fine-tuning.
3. **LLM Engineer**: Concentrates on developing practical LLM-based solutions and their deployment, encompassing the application of LLMs in real-world scenarios.
4. **LLM Value**: With the knowledge I have gained I will create a project using LLMs that will create value in emerging markets.

## The Context: Emerging Markets and Limited Resources
Emerging markets are characterized by vibrant economies and rapid growth but often grapple with limited resources. Burkina Faso, my birthplace, had a GDP of $12.7 billion in 2023, placing it at 129th globally in terms of GDP. Despite challenges, the country has shown a resilience in GDP growth, with an estimated increase of 3.7% in 2023 and 3.9% in 2024, although these figures are below the 6% average for 2017–19 [oai_citation:1,Burkina Faso Economic Outlook | African Development Bank Group - Making a Difference](https://www.afdb.org/en/countries/west-africa/burkina-faso/burkina-faso-economic-outlook) [oai_citation:2,Error](data:text/plain;charset=utf-8,Unable%20to%20find%20metadata) [oai_citation:3,Error](data:text/plain;charset=utf-8,Unable%20to%20find%20metadata).

## The Learning Approach: Public and Inclusive
I adopt a “learn in public” method to demystify LLM complexities and engage a broad audience. This approach fosters community learning and resonates with individuals and organizations in similar resource-constrained environments.

## The Hardware: Modesty as a Necessity
My primary tool is a $200 Acer machine with an Intel Core i3 processor and 8 GB of RAM. This choice mirrors the hardware available in many emerging markets and attempts to challenge the notion that cutting-edge AI research requires high-end equipment. Caveat: I will also use Colab Pro sparingly when my machine is not enough.

## The Impact: Bridging Gaps and Fostering Growth
By learning and experimenting publicly, I aim to bridge the knowledge gap between advanced AI technologies and their application in emerging markets, understanding their potential to transform societies, economies, and lives.

## The Pro Bono Initiative: Amoeba Data
Complementing this journey is my work with Amoeba Data, a pro bono data science consultancy that assists organizations in using data science and AI for social good, closely aligning with my mission to harness LLMs for societal improvement in emerging economies.

## Conclusion: A Call to Collaborative Learning
This journey is an open invitation for collaboration, learning, and innovation. It underscores the power of public learning and the potential of low-resource hardware in unlocking AI benefits for emerging markets.
