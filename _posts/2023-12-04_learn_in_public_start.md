# Understanding the Influence of Large Language Models on Emerging Markets: A Journey of Learning in Public on Low-Resource Hardware

## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, Large Language Models (LLMs) are at the forefront of AI innovation. As a data scientist with a passion for both technology and societal progress, I've embarked on an exploratory journey to understand the impact of these sophisticated models, particularly in the context of emerging markets. This journey is unique because it's undertaken on modest hardware, reflective of the technological realities in many developing regions.

## The Context: Emerging Markets and Limited Resources

Emerging markets, characterized by their vibrant economies and rapid growth, often face the dual challenge of harnessing cutting-edge technology and grappling with resource limitations. My birthplace, Burkina Faso, is a prime example. It's a nation with immense potential yet constrained by limited access to advanced computing resources. This dichotomy forms the backdrop of my exploration.

## The Learning Approach: Public and Inclusive

Adopting a "learn in public" approach, I aim to demystify the complexities of LLMs and make my findings accessible to a broader audience. This method not only fosters community learning and engagement but also resonates with individuals and organizations in similar resource-constrained environments.

## The Hardware: Modesty as a Necessity

My primary tool in this endeavor is a budget-friendly Acer machine, powered by an Intel Core i3 processor and 8 GB of RAM. While seemingly modest, this setup is a deliberate choice, mirroring the hardware available in many emerging markets. It challenges the notion that cutting-edge AI research is exclusive to those with access to high-end equipment.

## The Exploration: LLMs in Low-Resource Settings

My exploration revolves around practical applications of LLMs in scenarios typical of emerging markets. This includes understanding language nuances, cultural contexts, and economic implications. The goal is to uncover how LLMs can contribute to sectors like education, healthcare, and local businesses, thereby driving economic growth and social advancement.

## The Impact: Bridging Gaps and Fostering Growth

By learning and experimenting in public, I hope to bridge the knowledge gap between advanced AI technologies and their application in emerging markets. This journey is not just about leveraging LLMs but also about understanding their potential to transform societies, economies, and lives in regions that stand to benefit the most.

## The Pro Bono Initiative: Amoeba Data

Complementing this personal journey is my work with Amoeba Data, a pro bono data science consultancy. Here, we assist organizations in utilizing data science and AI for social good, aligning closely with my mission to harness LLMs for societal betterment in emerging economies.

## Conclusion: A Call to Collaborative Learning

This journey is an open invitation for collaboration, learning, and innovation. It's a testament to the power of public learning and the potential of low-resource hardware in unlocking the benefits of AI for emerging markets. Join me in this exploration, where every challenge overcome and insight gained brings us closer to a world where advanced technology is not just a privilege but a tool for universal progress.
