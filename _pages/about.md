Hello, I'm Thierry, a data scientist exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) on modest hardware. My academic background includes a sociology degree from the University of Maryland and data science training from Y Combinator's Sharpest Minds and Bloomtech Institute. Previously, I worked with SAIC on a Department of Homeland Security project, enhancing ELIS.

My focus is on understanding LLMs' influence in developing countries, inspired by my birthplace, Burkina Faso, a low GDP country in West Africa. I'm interested in how LLMs might affect these countries' economic growth and social dynamics.

I adopt a "learn in public" approach, sharing my journey and findings on a budget-friendly Acer machine, equipped with an Intel Core i3 processor and 8 GB of RAM. This choice reflects the limited computing resources in developing regions. While I sometimes use Google Colab Pro, my primary tool is this basic setup.

Additionally, I manage a Pro Bono data science consultancy, aiding organizations that positively impact the world. My mission is to uncover how LLMs can be harnessed for the betterment of emerging economies and societal advancement.
