Hi, I'm Thierry, a data scientist exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) on modest hardware. My academic background includes a sociology degree from the University of Maryland and data science training from Y Combinator's Sharpest Minds and Bloomtech Institute. Previously, I worked with SAIC on a Department of Homeland Security project, enhancing ELIS.

My focus is on understanding LLMs' influence in emerging markets, inspired by my birthplace, Burkina Faso, a low GDP country in West Africa. I'm interested in how LLMs might postively or negatively affect these markets' economic growth and social dynamics.

I adopt a "learn in public" approach, sharing my journey and findings on a budget-friendly Acer machine, equipped with an Intel Core i3 processor and 8 GB of RAM. This choice reflects the limited computing resources in emerging regions. While I sometimes use Google Colab Pro, my primary tool is this basic setup.

I also manage a Pro Bono data science consultancy, Amoeba Data, aiding organizations and projects that positively impact the world. My mission is to uncover how LLMs can be harnessed for the betterment of emerging economies and societal advancement.
